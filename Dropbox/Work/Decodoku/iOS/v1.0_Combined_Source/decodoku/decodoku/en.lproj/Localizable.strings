// science

It gives you all you need to conduct scientific research in the field of quantum error correction.\n\nThe grid represents a device that can protect a quantum computer against errors. The numbers are traces of the errors. When you remove the groups of numbers, you remove the errors too. Find a good method and share it with us. You could help us to build a real quantum computer!\n\nMore information at:\n\ndecodoku.blogspot.com (English)\n\ndecodokuDE.blogspot.com (German)";
